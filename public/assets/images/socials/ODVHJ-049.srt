00:00:15.340 --> 00:01:52.030
  Hello?

1
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.030
  Hello?

2
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030
  Yes.

3
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.470
  It's my first time, but is it okay now?

4
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.470
  Yes.

5
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.470
  Yes, that's right.

6
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.470
  Is it okay?

7
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.470
  Well, from now on,

8
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.470
  Please in 60 minutes.

9
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.470
  Yes.

10
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.580
  Yes.

11
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580
  Yes, yes.

12
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.720
  The address is

13
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.400
  Please in 60 minutes.

14
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440
  Yes.

15
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.180
  Oh, hello.

16
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180
  Hello.

17
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.180
  I'm Reiko, who just came from the president's massage.

18
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.180
  Oh, thank you.

19
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.180
  Thank you.

20
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.180
  It's very beautiful.

21
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.180
  Thank you.

22
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.180
  Please come in.

23
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.180
  Yes, excuse me.

24
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.180
  It's hard to pack.

25
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.990
  Is it comfortable?

26
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.990
  Yes.

27
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.990
  You seem to be angry.

28
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.990
  That's right.

29
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:32.790
  Do you often get a massage?

30
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.790
  Not at all.

31
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.490
  It's hard to pack so much.

32
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.490
  Really?

33
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.490
  Yes.

34
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.490
  Wow.

35
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.920
  Are you okay?

36
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920
  Yes.

37
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.920
  That's good.

38
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.920
  Is this job long?

39
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.920
  Well,

40
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.920
  It's been about two or three years.

41
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920
  I'm getting used to it.

42
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920
  Yes.

43
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:25.210
  It's good.

44
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.210
  It's beautiful.

45
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.210
  The massage is good.

46
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.210
  It's the best.

47
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.210
  Not at all.

48
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.210
  Thank you very much.

49
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.210
  Yes.

50
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:45.660
  Could you turn around a little?

51
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.660
  Yes.

52
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.320
  Thank you very much.

53
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:25.620
  Excuse me.

54
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:43.970
  It's okay.

55
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.970
  What's wrong?

56
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.970
  What?

57
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.970
  Something.

58
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.410
  Oh, I'm sorry.

59
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.410
  Reiko's massage is a little

60
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.410
  It's very comfortable.

61
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.410
  I'm sorry.

62
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.130
  What?

63
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.130
  It's okay.

64
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.130
  It's because it feels good.

65
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:16.490
  Yes.

66
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.490
  If it was so good, everyone would have gotten angry.

67
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.490
  What?

68
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.490
  I'm sorry.

69
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.490
  I'm really sorry.

70
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:36.100
  If you have any, please send me a message.

71
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.100
  I'm sorry.

72
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.100
  What?

73
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.100
  That's a little ...

74
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:51.030
  Is the center of the body okay?

75
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.030
  Here?

76
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.030
  Here?

77
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.030
  It's so stiff.

78
00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:04.980
  What?

79
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.980
  The center of the body is the most slender.

80
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.980
  That's right.

81
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:36.140
  But here ...

82
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.140
  Please.

83
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.780
  I can't let go of your hand.

84
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.780
  Are you not satisfied?

85
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.780
  That's not true.

86
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.990
  Maybe you haven't slept at all with your husband.

87
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:07.830
  I'm really in trouble.

88
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.660
  Do you have a rope?

89
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.660
  What is a rope?

90
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.660
  What?

91
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.660
  What?

92
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.660
  This is a free service.

93
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.660
  I don't have such a thing.

94
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.660
  You don't have it?

95
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.660
  Yes.

96
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.660
  Then just a little.

97
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.660
  What?

98
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.660
  You don't have to move, so please use it a little.

99
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.660
  Please.

100
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.660
  It's tight and dangerous.

101
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.660
  What?

102
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.660
  Please.

103
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.660
  What?

104
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.230
  You don't have to move your hands, I'll move them.

105
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.230
  What?

106
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:52.450
  No.

107
00:08:53.450 --> 00:09:02.710
  You look very happy.

108
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.710
  No.

109
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:33.540
  What should I do?

110
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.540
  What?

111
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.540
  No.

112
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.540
  You don't feel good just touching it?

113
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.540
  That's not true.

114
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.540
  Really?

115
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.540
  Can you lick it a little?

116
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.540
  What?

117
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.540
  Just a little.

118
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.540
  What?

119
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.540
  Just a little.

120
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.540
  Just a little?

121
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.750
  Just a little.

122
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.750
  Is that okay?

123
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.750
  You are very kind.

124
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.750
  Thank you.

125
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:20.460
  You said you were amazing.

126
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.460
  Your tinkle is amazing.

127
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.770
  Excuse me.

128
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:50.810
  Do you like tinkle?

129
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.810
  No.

130
00:11:04.120 --> 00:12:17.130
  I have to do it again.

131
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.130
  What?

132
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.130
  It's okay.

133
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.720
  What do you mean?

134
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:46.130
  I'll take it out from here.

135
00:12:48.130 --> 00:13:27.370
  Let me see.

136
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
  Your stomach is very hard.

137
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:59.150
  It's embarrassing.

138
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.150
  It's embarrassing?

139
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.150
  Why are you embarrassed?

140
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.150
  Why is your tinkle so hard?

141
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.910
  Your tinkle is amazing.

142
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:35.220
  Are you okay?

143
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.370
  It's okay.

144
00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.370
  I'm scared.

145
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720
  I can see everything.

146
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720
  No.

147
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720
  Please stick out more.

148
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.760
  Excuse me.

149
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.760
  1, 2, 3.

150
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.020
  I'll give you water.

151
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.960
  Are you okay?

152
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.960
  It's hot.

153
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960
  Amazing.

154
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.450
  Amazing.

155
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.450
  Does it feel good?

156
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.450
  No.

157
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.460
  Do you want to do something?

158
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.460
  What do you think it is?

159
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.460
  No.

160
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.460
  No.

161
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.460
  What do you think it is?

162
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.460
  What?

163
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.460
  Don't you want to spill this big blood?

164
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.460
  I can't do that.

165
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.460
  You don't want to do it with your husband, do you?

166
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.460
  No.

167
00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.460
  You don't want to do it with your husband, do you?

168
00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.460
  But...

169
00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.460
  But what?

170
00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.460
  You don't want to do it with your husband, do you?

171
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.460
  You don't want to be exposed, do you?

172
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:13.000
  Open your legs.

173
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
  It's going to go in.

174
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.660
  It's hot.

175
00:26:42.660 --> 00:27:27.080
  It's okay.

176
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.530
  Please be quiet.

177
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.530
  It's hot.

178
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.780
  Please be quiet.

179
00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.380
  It's going to go in.

180
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.380
  Please be quiet.

181
00:34:36.380 --> 00:35:17.350
  What do you want to do?

182
00:37:44.540 --> 00:38:58.480
  Your neck is chipped.

183
00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.750
  It's the limit of endurance.

184
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.750
  Can I put it out?

185
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.750
  No, you can't.

186
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.750
  I can't put it out?

187
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.750
  Then I'll put it out in your mouth.

188
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.750
  It's going to go in.

189
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.750
  Okay.

190
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.320
  Show me your mouth.

191
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:30.500
  I'm sorry, but please keep it a secret.

192
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.500
  I won't tell you.

193
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.810
  Are you satisfied with the massage?

194
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:37.810
  Of course.

195
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:39.810
  Thank you.

196
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.810
  I'll be waiting for your next assignment.

197
00:40:49.000 --> 00:42:15.220
  It's going to go in.

198
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.270
  Hello?

199
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.270
  Yes.

200
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.270
  I'd like to have a massage.

201
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.270
  Yes.

202
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.270
  I see.

203
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.270
  I'd like you to come right away.

204
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.270
  Yes.

205
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.270
  If you're available.

206
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.270
  Yes, that's right.

207
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.270
  I see.

208
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:57.710
  I see.

209
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.760
  Hello.

210
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.760
  I'm Shiori from Hitozuma.

211
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.760
  Nice to meet you.

212
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760
  Nice to meet you.

213
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.760
  Please come in.

214
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.760
  Thank you.

215
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.760
  Hello.

216
00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:43.550
  Does your back hurt a lot?

217
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.550
  Yes.

218
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.550
  I often sit down.

219
00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:48.550
  Okay.

220
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.550
  My back hurts a lot.

221
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.550
  It's hard.

222
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:55.550
  I see.

223
00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.550
  Is your strength okay?

224
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.550
  Yes, it's okay.

225
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.550
  Okay.

226
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:09.660
  I heard that you're a newcomer to the shop.

227
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.660
  Yes.

228
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.660
  You're good.

229
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.660
  I'm a newcomer to the shop, but I used to work at another shop.

230
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.660
  I see.

231
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.660
  Yes.

232
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.660
  I see.

233
00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.570
  You're really good.

234
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.460
  Please tell me if it hurts.

235
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.460
  Okay.

236
00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.800
  Your back is just right.

237
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.800
  Thank you.

238
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.800
  Do you do desk work?

239
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.800
  No, I'm not doing desk work.

240
00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.800
  I'm doing something like a free lighter.

241
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.800
  I see.

242
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.800
  I see.

243
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.800
  You're working on a computer.

244
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.800
  Yes.

245
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.500
  I'm working on a computer.

246
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.500
  You're working on your neck and shoulders.

247
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.500
  Yes.

248
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.500
  I'm glad you came to my shop.

249
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:20.980
  I'm going to...

250
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.980
  Yes.

251
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.550
  Yes.

252
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:29.550
  If you don't want to answer, you don't have to answer.

253
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:30.550
  Okay.

254
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.550
  I had a question about your shop.

255
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.550
  Okay.

256
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:41.550
  Are you getting married?

257
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.550
  Yes.

258
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:43.550
  I see.

259
00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:47.550
  I envy you.

260
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.550
  No.

261
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.550
  There are so many beautiful people at home every day.

262
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:53.550
  No.

263
00:45:53.550 --> 00:46:00.590
  Do you give your husband a massage?

264
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.590
  Not really.

265
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:03.590
  I see.

266
00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:05.590
  He gets tired.

267
00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:06.590
  I see.

268
00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.590
  Your husband?

269
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:08.590
  Yes.

270
00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:09.590
  I see.

271
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:15.590
  I'd like to have your husband's baby.

272
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:16.590
  I see.

273
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:22.080
  Are you married?

274
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.080
  No, I'm not.

275
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.080
  You're still young.

276
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.080
  I'm old enough to get married.

277
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.080
  But I don't have a boyfriend.

278
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.080
  I see.

279
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.080
  I don't have a boyfriend.

280
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.780
  You don't have a boyfriend.

281
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.780
  I see.

282
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.780
  I'm stuck at home all the time.

283
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.780
  I don't have a chance to meet him.

284
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:53.470
  I have a lonely life.

285
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:54.470
  I see.

286
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.470
  I think it's time.

287
00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.470
  I see.

288
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.820
  I'd like to have blue hair.

289
00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.820
  Okay.

290
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.900
  Your legs are swollen.

291
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:44.350
  I see.

292
00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.350
  Your thighs are swollen, too.

293
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:48.350
  Really?

294
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:49.350
  Yes.

295
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:55.690
  I don't know much about myself.

296
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:56.690
  I see.

297
00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.690
  I have to ask a specialist to check my legs.

298
00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:23.220
  I see.

299
00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:43.730
  Your legs are swollen.

300
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:44.730
  I'm sorry.

301
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:45.730
  It's okay.

302
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.730
  I have a lint roller.

303
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:48.730
  It hurts.

304
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:49.730
  I see.

305
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.730
  I'll press it lightly.

306
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:53.730
  It's okay.

307
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.730
  I don't need a massage.

308
00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:41.110
  Oh, my.

309
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:43.110
  I'm sorry.

310
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.110
  It's okay.

311
00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:48.110
  It's been a long time since I've had a massage.

312
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:49.110
  It feels good.

313
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.110
  It's good for my blood circulation.

314
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.110
  I've had a stomachache.

315
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.110
  It's common.

316
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.110
  Don't worry about it.

317
00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.110
  Is it common?

318
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.110
  I have a lot of male customers.

319
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.110
  You have a stomachache?

320
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.110
  Yes.

321
00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:05.110
  I see.

322
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.110
  Are you used to it?

323
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.110
  No.

324
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.110
  That's right.

325
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:14.110
  I encounter such a situation.

326
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:15.110
  I see.

327
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:16.110
  I see.

328
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.620
  Shiori.

329
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:20.620
  Yes.

330
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.620
  Do you have a lint roller?

331
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.620
  Do you have a lint roller?

332
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.620
  What's a lint roller?

333
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.620
  You'll understand when I say lint roller.

334
00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.060
  It's useless.

335
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.060
  I don't have such a service.

336
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.060
  I'm sorry.

337
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:41.060
  But you said you had a stomachache.

338
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:46.060
  I can't do anything more just by having a stomachache.

339
00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.060
  I see.

340
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.060
  Yes.

341
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.060
  I see.

342
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.060
  I'm sorry.

343
00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.060
  No, no.

344
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.060
  You shouldn't do that.

345
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.060
  No, no.

346
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.060
  It's okay.

347
00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.060
  I see.

348
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.400
  It's easy to do.

349
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400
  I have to move.

350
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400
  It's okay.

351
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.400
  I'll give you a massage.

352
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.400
  I'll do it on time.

353
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.400
  That's right.

354
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:29.820
  It's the first time I've had a massage in front of me.

355
00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.820
  A massage?

356
00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:31.820
  No.

357
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:32.820
  You're doing a terrible job.

358
00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.820
  I'm sorry.

359
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.820
  Please stop.

360
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.820
  I can't concentrate on the massage.

361
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:42.820
  It's okay, right?

362
00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.820
  No, it's not okay.

363
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.820
  It's okay.

364
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:46.820
  Please stop.

365
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:50.820
  Shiori, you can hold my hand.

366
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.820
  What?

367
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.820
  I'll move it.

368
00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.820
  No, no, no.

369
00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.820
  This part is the hardest.

370
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.820
  What?

371
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:03.820
  I'm in trouble.

372
00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.820
  You said you should stand up.

373
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:06.820
  No, no.

374
00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:07.820
  You said you should stand up.

375
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.820
  I didn't say that.

376
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.820
  You said you should stand up to massage your feet.

377
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.820
  That's not what I meant.

378
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:17.820
  No.

379
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.820
  That's why I said you should stand up.

380
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.820
  Let me stand up.

381
00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.820
  No.

382
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:27.140
  I don't want to be scolded by the store anymore.

383
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.140
  No, that's why you should run away.

384
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.140
  What?

385
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.140
  It's okay.

386
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.640
  It's so big.

387
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.980
  I'll move it.

388
00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:49.670
  It feels good.

389
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:58.420
  You're good at massaging.

390
00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.420
  Yes.

391
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.420
  You're good at this too.

392
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.420
  Is it okay now?

393
00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.420
  No, no, no.

394
00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:08.420
  You have to relax properly.

395
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.420
  You have to relax.

396
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.420
  I don't know how to relax.

397
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.420
  Relaxing is like a massage.

398
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.420
  You know what I mean?

399
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.770
  Please stop.

400
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:36.770
  I'm trying to convey the image of gently massaging.

401
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:47.110
  It feels good.

402
00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:50.110
  I'm having a hard time these days.

403
00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:53.110
  No, no, no.

404
00:53:58.690 --> 00:54:06.310
  You're good at this.

405
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.310
  Yes.

406
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:14.310
  You're massaging gently.

407
00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:42.770
  Please don't tell the store.

408
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:43.770
  Just a little.

409
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:44.770
  It'll be over soon.

410
00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:56.980
  It's soft.

411
00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.980
  Is that so?

412
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:13.180
  I want you to do it clearly.

413
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.180
  What?

414
00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.180
  The real thing?

415
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.180
  I want you to do it clearly.

416
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.180
  What do you mean by the real thing?

417
00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.180
  I'm sorry.

418
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:27.180
  I didn't expect you to do that.

419
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.180
  I misheard you.

420
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:39.420
  It's the real thing, isn't it?

421
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.420
  I didn't say that.

422
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.120
  I'm fine with this much.

423
00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.460
  I'm fine with this much.

424
00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.460
  Isn't it?

425
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:18.680
  Your nipples are here, aren't they?

426
00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.680
  No, they're not.

427
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.680
  Please tell me where they are.

428
00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.980
  Where are the nipples?

429
00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.980
  I don't know where the nipples are.

430
00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.980
  Can I look for them?

431
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:53.990
  It's soft.

432
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:30.790
  Is your husband biting you?

433
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:34.790
  I don't get along with my husband.

434
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.790
  Why?

435
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.790
  It's a pity.

436
00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.020
  Your nipples are very long.

437
00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.020
  Are they long?

438
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.020
  No, they're not.

439
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.020
  Really?

440
00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:59.020
  They look long to me.

441
00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:20.770
  Your nipples are so long that you can see them.

442
00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:26.320
  Look at your nipples.

443
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.320
  They're wet, aren't they?

444
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.320
  Aren't they?

445
00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.980
  No, they're not.

446
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.980
  They're not wet?

447
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:43.980
  I wonder what the nipples are.

448
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.540
  They're soaked.

449
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:58.220
  Your nipples are so long.

450
00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:05.940
  No, they're not.

451
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.940
  They're wet.

452
00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.940
  What are you saying?

453
00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.940
  I'm sorry.

454
00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:24.600
  It's okay.

455
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:33.710
  Do you do this every day?

456
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:36.710
  Do you have nipples other than your husband?

457
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.710
  No, I don't.

458
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.940
  Your nipples are sticking out.

459
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.620
  Long time no see.

460
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.770
  Yes.

461
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.770
  It's been a long time.

462
01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:25.770
  Your nipples are wet, aren't they?

463
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:27.770
  No, they're not.

464
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.080
  Really?

465
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.080
  Your pants are wet.

466
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.380
  Your pants are wet, but your nipples are sticking out.

467
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400
  Your nipples are sticking out.

468
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.540
  Your nipples are sticking out.

469
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.540
  Your nipples are sticking out.

470
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.540
  Your nipples are sticking out.

471
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.540
  You're making a great sound.

472
01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:30.330
  You like being patted.

473
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.590
  What's the matter?

474
01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:42.440
  What's the matter?

475
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440
  What's the matter?

476
01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.440
  I'm scared.

477
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.880
  You're scared?

478
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.880
  I'm scared.

479
01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.880
  I'm scared.

480
01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:59.880
  I'm scared.

481
01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.880
  I'm scared.

482
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.880
  I'm scared.

483
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:18.110
  What's the matter?

484
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.110
  What's the matter?

485
01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:23.870
  Don't look at me.

486
01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:17.100
  It feels good.

487
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:31.270
  Don't look at me.

488
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.500
  Your finger went in.

489
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:03.350
  You're a baby.

490
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:06.350
  Your nipples are small.

491
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:27.050
  It feels good.

492
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.210
  It feels good.

493
01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.740
  Your nipples are small.

494
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:27.610
  Don't look at me.

495
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:21.460
  It feels good.

496
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.040
  How far can you go?

497
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.040
  How far can you go?

498
01:06:41.040 --> 01:07:15.870
  Just your mouth.

499
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:18.870
  It feels really good.

500
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:27.500
  You're really good at licking.

501
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500
  You're really good at licking.

502
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.500
  Really?

503
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:40.060
  Yeah.

504
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.060
  Can I do it?

505
01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.060
  No.

506
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.060
  It's okay.

507
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.060
  We've come this far.

508
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.060
  We've come this far.

509
01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:53.820
  We're going to keep it a secret.

510
01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.820
  We're going to keep it a secret.

511
01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.820
  We're going to keep it a secret.

512
01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:20.680
  You're sleeping well.

513
01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:36.540
  You're sleeping well.

514
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:42.940
  Ah.

515
01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.940
  Ah.

516
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.750
  Ah.

517
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:53.750
  I haven't been with my husband lately.

518
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.750
  I haven't been with my husband lately.

519
01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.750
  I'm not feeling well.

520
01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.750
  I'm not feeling well.

521
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:09.750
  Ah.

522
01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.750
  It feels good.

523
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.130
  Ah.

524
01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.130
  You have a sexy body.

525
01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:27.800
  When did you get it?

526
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.800
  When did you get it?

527
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.800
  It's been a year.

528
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.800
  Really?

529
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.800
  You're so young.

530
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.800
  I'd do it every day.

531
01:09:37.800 --> 01:10:33.020
  Ah.

532
01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:44.970
  Ah.

533
01:10:44.970 --> 01:11:13.370
  Ah.

534
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:15.370
  Stretch out your legs.

535
01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:17.370
  Ah.

536
01:11:17.370 --> 01:12:14.180
  Shibu,

537
01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.180
  bend down yourself.

538
01:12:16.180 --> 01:14:07.270
  Ah.

539
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:09.270
  It's been a while.

540
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:11.270
  How do you feel?

541
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:13.270
  How do you feel?

542
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:15.270
  Ah.

543
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:39.960
  Ah.

544
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:47.050
  Ah.

545
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:49.050
  How do you feel?

546
01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:52.740
  Ah.

547
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.740
  Ah.

548
01:14:54.740 --> 01:15:05.350
  Ah.

549
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:07.350
  Ah.

550
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:40.200
  Ah.

551
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.200
  Ah.

552
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200
  Ah.

553
01:15:44.200 --> 01:16:21.720
  Ah.

554
01:16:21.720 --> 01:17:08.390
  Ah.

555
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:12.660
  Ah.

556
01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.660
  Ah.

557
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.660
  Ah.

558
01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:18.660
  Ah.

559
01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:20.660
  Ah.

560
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.660
  Ah.

561
01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:26.100
  Ah.

562
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:43.750
  Ah.

563
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:45.750
  Ah.

564
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.750
  Ah.

565
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:53.050
  Ah.

566
01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:55.050
  Ah.

567
01:17:55.050 --> 01:18:06.940
  Ah.

568
01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.940
  That's not good.

569
01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:09.940
  No?

570
01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.940
  Not inside.

571
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.940
  If it's not inside, can I go anywhere?

572
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.940
  Yes.

573
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:34.700
  This is how I feel.

574
01:18:46.520 --> 01:19:23.200
  I'm sorry.

575
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.200
  I told you not to go inside.

576
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.200
  I don't want to mess up anything else.

577
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.200
  It's okay.

578
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:42.010
  I don't want to mess up anything else.

579
01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:43.010
  I'm sorry.

580
01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:45.010
  It's okay.

581
01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:56.190
  Please don't clean up.

582
01:19:57.190 --> 01:20:10.780
  Please don't do this again.

583
01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:12.780
  Of course.

584
01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.780
  Did you feel good?

585
01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:21.350
  I'm waiting for your order again.

586
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:22.350
  I'm coming.

587
01:20:22.350 --> 01:21:19.380
  What?

588
01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.380
  The chief massage.

589
01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.380
  The real person will heal you.

590
01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:33.170
  I'll make an appointment.

591
01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:35.170
  Hello?

592
01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:36.170
  Yes.

593
01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:37.170
  Yes.

594
01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:41.170
  I'd like to call you home right now.

595
01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:42.170
  Are you okay?

596
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:44.170
  Yes.

597
01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:45.170
  Really?

598
01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:49.170
  Can you close this?

599
01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:51.170
  Yes.

600
01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:52.170
  Yes.

601
01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:58.170
  I'm looking at your website.

602
01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:00.170
  Sarah, are you okay?

603
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:02.170
  Yes.

604
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:04.170
  Yes, please.

605
01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.340
  Hello.

606
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:29.340
  I'm Sarah from Hitotsuma Massage.

607
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.340
  Nice to meet you.

608
01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.340
  Please come in.

609
01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:33.340
  Thank you.

610
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:40.290
  Please come in.

611
01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:50.810
  How is your strength?

612
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:52.810
  It's perfect.

613
01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:53.810
  Is it perfect?

614
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:54.810
  Yes.

615
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:55.810
  You're strong.

616
01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:56.810
  Are you okay?

617
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:57.810
  Yes.

618
01:22:57.810 --> 01:22:59.810
  I'm strong.

619
01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.810
  Do you have a sense of self-awareness?

620
01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:02.810
  Yes.

621
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:04.810
  It's very hard.

622
01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:06.810
  Is it very hard?

623
01:23:06.810 --> 01:23:07.810
  It's very hard.

624
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:08.810
  It's very hard.

625
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960
  Is it okay?

626
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960
  Yes, please.

627
01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.960
  It's very hard.

628
01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.960
  It's very hard.

629
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.960
  Isn't it painful when it's so hard?

630
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.960
  It happens sometimes.

631
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.960
  That's right.

632
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.960
  This shop is called Hitotsuma Massage.

633
01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.960
  Yes.

634
01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.960
  Are you really from Hitotsuma?

635
01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:42.960
  Yes.

636
01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:43.960
  Really?

637
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960
  Of course I'm from Hitotsuma.

638
01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.960
  All the children in the shop are married.

639
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960
  That's right.

640
01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.960
  It says Hitotsuma.

641
01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.960
  I'm a little worried.

642
01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.960
  That's right.

643
01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.960
  Please put a little more pressure on your back.

644
01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:13.250
  Okay.

645
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.250
  Does it hurt?

646
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.250
  It feels good.

647
01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.250
  Is it okay?

648
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:26.640
  Your body is getting hot.

649
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.640
  Really?

650
01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.640
  It's a sign of lymph flow.

651
01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.640
  Is that so?

652
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.640
  Yes.

653
01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.780
  How is it?

654
01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.780
  Is it better than before?

655
01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.780
  That's right.

656
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.780
  Does it hurt?

657
01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.780
  That's right.

658
01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:50.780
  Does it feel good?

659
01:24:50.780 --> 01:25:06.770
  Excuse me.

660
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:13.020
  This muscle.

661
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:15.660
  How is it?

662
01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:30.130
  It's good, isn't it?

663
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:33.130
  It's about time to get arm muscles.

664
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:34.130
  Arm muscles?

665
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:35.130
  Yes.

666
01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:49.550
  Life alone is amazing.

667
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:51.550
  What are you talking about?

668
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:54.550
  Your feet.

669
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:55.550
  Please relax.

670
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:58.550
  Your feet are cold.

671
01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:00.550
  Why are your feet so cold?

672
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:01.550
  It was cold.

673
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:02.550
  It's cold.

674
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:05.550
  Only the tip of your feet is very cold.

675
01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:17.840
  Please relax.

676
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:58.880
  Does it feel good?

677
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.880
  It feels really good.

678
01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:39.560
  You're putting too much pressure on your back.

679
01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.560
  Please relax when you get a massage.

680
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560
  Okay.

681
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560
  Don't put too much pressure on your back.

682
01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.560
  Okay.

683
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:52.670
  This is the calf muscle.

684
01:27:52.670 --> 01:27:53.670
  Okay.

685
01:27:53.670 --> 01:27:54.670
  This is the calf muscle.

686
01:27:54.670 --> 01:28:01.220
  I'm going to massage it.

687
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.220
  There is lymph.

688
01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:06.220
  If you get stuck here, your whole body's blood will freeze.

689
01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:09.220
  That's why your feet are so cold.

690
01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:10.220
  I see.

691
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.220
  Excuse me.

692
01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:15.220
  What?

693
01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:20.670
  Well...

694
01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:24.710
  What's wrong?

695
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:25.710
  What?

696
01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:27.710
  Well...

697
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:29.710
  I'm sorry.

698
01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:32.710
  Please lift your buttocks.

699
01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:35.710
  Your pants are tight.

700
01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:39.710
  Excuse me.

701
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.600
  Hey.

702
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.600
  You're young.

703
01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360
  You'll get better.

704
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360
  Well...

705
01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.360
  Yes?

706
01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.360
  Isn't there a lab here?

707
01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.760
  What's a lab?

708
01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760
  Well...

709
01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.760
  It's a free service.

710
01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.760
  Free?

711
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.760
  Yes.

712
01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.760
  Well...

713
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.760
  It's not here.

714
01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.760
  It's just a massage shop.

715
01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.760
  Wait a minute.

716
01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.760
  Wait a minute.

717
01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.760
  No, no.

718
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.760
  Just a little massage.

719
01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:31.640
  What?

720
01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.640
  Well...

721
01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:37.640
  If you get angry at the shop,

722
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:45.040
  No, it's not like that.

723
01:29:49.120 --> 01:30:03.860
  Please calm down.

724
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:05.860
  I'm calm.

725
01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:09.710
  You're calm?

726
01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:11.710
  Well...

727
01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:15.710
  There's no such thing at the shop.

728
01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.710
  No, no.

729
01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:19.710
  Just a little massage is fine.

730
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:21.710
  What?

731
01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:23.710
  Just a little more.

732
01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:24.710
  What?

733
01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:26.710
  It's hot.

734
01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.040
  My toes are cold.

735
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.040
  It's so hot in here.

736
01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:44.040
  Well...

737
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.040
  Yes?

738
01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.040
  Just a little more.

739
01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.040
  Well...

740
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:59.470
  If you just touch it...

741
01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:01.470
  I'll massage your back.

742
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:04.470
  Like this?

743
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:14.860
  Well...

744
01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:15.860
  Is it okay?

745
01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:32.430
  Did you feel better when you were being massaged?

746
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:39.540
  Yes.

747
01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.540
  It's hard.

748
01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.540
  Wait a minute.

749
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.260
  It's hard.

750
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.260
  I'm surprised because it's big.

751
01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:52.790
  Can I get a massage in person?

752
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:53.790
  What?

753
01:31:53.790 --> 01:32:00.140
  Well...

754
01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:08.240
  What should I do if it's hot?

755
01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:28.510
  Does it feel good?

756
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:29.510
  Yes.

757
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:31.510
  Which one feels better?

758
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:32.510
  This one feels better.

759
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:34.510
  This one feels better?

760
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:36.510
  It's healthy.

761
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:49.260
  It's getting hot.

762
01:32:49.260 --> 01:33:18.640
  It's getting so big that I can't hold it in one hand.

763
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.640
  Yes?

764
01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.640
  I can't stand it either.

765
01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:27.680
  Can I do it?

766
01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.680
  What?

767
01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.680
  What is it?

768
01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.680
  I want to do more.

769
01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.680
  You want to do more?

770
01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:34.680
  Yes.

771
01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.680
  What are you talking about?

772
01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.680
  You don't have to tell me.

773
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.680
  Well...

774
01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:41.680
  It's okay.

775
01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.680
  It's okay.

776
01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:51.990
  Wait a minute.

777
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:54.990
  Can I do it with my hands?

778
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:57.990
  No, I can't do it with just my hands.

779
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.990
  Well...

780
01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:00.990
  Please.

781
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:13.530
  It's going to be on my neck.

782
01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:14.530
  It's okay.

783
01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:19.570
  I'm begging you.

784
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:20.570
  Please.

785
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:22.570
  I'm begging you.

786
01:34:22.570 --> 01:34:25.570
  I don't like you and Sarah here.

787
01:34:25.570 --> 01:34:28.570
  Well, that's right.

788
01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:36.550
  You'll never find out.

789
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:39.550
  Well...

790
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:41.550
  Let's calm down.

791
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:43.550
  I'm calm.

792
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:45.550
  Please.

793
01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.780
  Wait a minute.

794
01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.780
  Can you really not tell me?

795
01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:41.360
  I don't want to.

796
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:49.980
  My hands are so dirty.

797
01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:55.380
  Sarah's body is very warm.

798
01:35:55.380 --> 01:36:00.380
  If I do this, I'll get hot.

799
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:42.130
  Oh, no.

800
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:12.550
  I'm going to give you a massage.

801
01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:24.720
  Don't look at me.

802
01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.720
  Sarah's body is very dirty.

803
01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:32.290
  Don't look at me.

804
01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:57.100
  I'm not sensitive.

805
01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:02.850
  I'm not sensitive.

806
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:40.760
  I'm not sensitive.

807
01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:03.460
  Wait a minute.

808
01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.460
  Wait a minute.

809
01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:32.670
  Wait a minute.

810
01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:34.670
  Wait a minute.

811
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:48.120
  Wait a minute.

812
01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:50.120
  Wait a minute.

813
01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:33.500
  Are you really not satisfied?

814
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.940
  Why?

815
01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.940
  You're getting more and more sexy.

816
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:45.940
  I'm going to do all kinds of nice things.

817
01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.940
  I'm going to do all kinds of nice things.

818
01:40:49.940 --> 01:41:07.480
  Yes, you're going to do it.

819
01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:13.050
  I'm not going to do it.

820
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:19.050
  I don't know...

821
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:43.820
  I don't know...

822
01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:56.920
  Why do you have so many tea bags at work?

823
01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:01.920
  It's not like that. I only have tea bags.

824
01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:27.450
  I can't do this at work.

825
01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.120
  I can't do this.

826
01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.120
  I can't stand it anymore.

827
01:42:54.190 --> 01:42:57.190
  I can see your buttocks and buttocks.

828
01:42:57.190 --> 01:42:59.190
  It hurts.

829
01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:15.520
  It's messy.

830
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:33.660
  Try moving it yourself.

831
01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:47.060
  It's so thick.

832
01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:16.400
  It's so thick.

833
01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.400
  I'm begging you.

834
01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:43.410
  Does it feel good?

835
01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:46.410
  I'll try to make you feel better.

836
01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.970
  It's okay now.

837
01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:13.970
  It was just the first round.

838
01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.040
  It's all round.

839
01:46:11.010 --> 01:46:14.010
  It's making a lot of noise.

840
01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:17.010
  Is it that messy?

841
01:46:17.010 --> 01:46:19.010
  It's very messy.

842
01:46:25.150 --> 01:46:29.040
  It hurts.

843
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:45.930
  Does it feel good?

844
01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:53.780
  It's harder than it looks.

845
01:47:53.780 --> 01:48:16.170
  Is it too big?

846
01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:22.540
  Please don't tell the store.

847
01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:32.450
  Of course.

848
01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:42.530
  It hurts.

849
01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:53.980
  How does it feel compared to your husband?

850
01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:56.980
  It's not like that.

851
01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:04.980
  Your husband is bigger and harder.

852
01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:10.620
  Look at my face.

853
01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:28.690
  Does it feel good?

854
01:49:54.770 --> 01:50:12.610
  Please don't tell the store.

855
01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:44.350
  Do you like being pinched?

856
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:46.350
  It feels good.

857
01:50:46.350 --> 01:51:59.040
  It's messy.

858
01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:26.390
  How does it feel?

859
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:29.390
  It's harder.

860
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:32.390
  Does it feel good?

861
01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:54.980
  I can't stand it anymore.

862
01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.870
  Does it feel good?

863
01:52:58.870 --> 01:53:00.870
  It's not like that.

864
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:03.870
  Please lie down.

865
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:05.870
  You understand, don't you?

866
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:09.870
  It's not like that.

867
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:11.870
  It's okay.

868
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:14.870
  Is it okay with your hands and mouth?

869
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:22.660
  It hurts.

870
01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:27.490
  It's okay.

871
01:53:27.490 --> 01:53:30.490
  Please don't tell the store.

872
01:53:30.490 --> 01:53:33.490
  Please don't tell the store.

873
01:53:33.490 --> 01:53:39.490
  Please don't tell the store.

874
01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:41.490
  It's going to be okay.

875
01:53:46.570 --> 01:54:08.490
  It's going to be okay.

876
01:54:08.490 --> 01:54:11.490
  It's not like that.

877
01:54:11.490 --> 01:54:15.250
  It's going to be okay.

878
01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:42.220
  It's going to be okay.

879
01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:46.220
  Does it feel good?

880
01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:54.240
  It's okay.

881
01:54:54.240 --> 01:55:01.370
  It feels good.

882
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:43.340
  I'm fine.

883
01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:47.340
  You don't like being fine?

884
01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:50.340
  It's amazing.

885
01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:41.810
  It's amazing.

886
01:57:23.890 --> 01:57:28.520
  It's crazy.

887
01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:31.520
  It's going to be okay.

888
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:33.520
  It's going to be okay.

889
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:43.100
  It's going to be okay.

890
01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:46.100
  It's going to be okay.

891
01:57:46.100 --> 01:58:05.010
  Achi-kun...

892
01:58:31.590 --> 01:59:01.120
  I'm sorry, I made you cry so much.

893
01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.120
  You're such a good girl.

894
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:52.930
  I'm sorry.

895
02:00:00.150 --> 02:00:20.780
  My butt feels so good.

896
02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:08.660
  No matter how hard I try...

897
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.740
  Do you want to do more?

898
02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:56.460
  Please.

899
02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:10.530
  Yes.

  Please look over here.

906
02:04:25.690 --> 02:04:34.440
  My butt feels so good.

  It feels so good.

908
02:04:56.490 --> 02:04:58.490
  It feels so good.

909
02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:21.050
  Sarah-san...

910
02:05:22.050 --> 02:05:24.050
  Can I put you inside?

911
02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:26.050
  No, you can't.

912
02:05:26.050 --> 02:05:28.050
  You can't put me inside.

913
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:32.380
  Please don't make fun of me.

914
02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:34.380
  Please don't make fun of me.

915
02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:37.380
  Please put Sarah-san's beautiful face inside.

916
02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:40.380
  Please don't make fun of me.

917
02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:53.300
  Please don't make fun of me.

918
02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:34.960
  Was the massage good?

919
02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:39.230
  Was the massage good?

920
02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:43.230
  Please don't make fun of me.

921
02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:46.230
  Please don't make fun of me.

922

  I'm sorry.

923
02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:54.460
  I'll be waiting for your next call.

924
02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:50.970
  This person is...

925
02:08:50.970 --> 02:08:51.970
  Hello?

926
02:08:51.970 --> 02:08:52.970
  Yes.

927
02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:55.970
  I called you from the home page.

928
02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:01.300
  Well...

929
02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:03.300
  The course...

930
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:06.300
  It's 60 minutes.

931
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:10.450
  Yes, that's right.

932
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:16.270
  It's 30 minutes later.

933
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:18.270
  I understand.

934
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:23.220
  Yes, I understand.

935
02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:27.220
  Yes, thank you.

936
02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:29.220
  Yes.

937
02:09:30.220 --> 02:10:02.890
  Are you sure it's Kayama-sama?

938
02:10:02.890 --> 02:10:03.890
  Yes.

939
02:10:03.890 --> 02:10:07.890
  I'm Chigusa from Chichou Massage.

940
02:10:07.890 --> 02:10:09.890
  Nice to meet you.

941

  Please come in.

942
02:10:11.890 --> 02:10:13.890
  Thank you.

943
02:10:13.890 --> 02:10:24.300
  You're really good.

944
02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:25.300
  Really?

945
02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:27.300
  Is it okay if I use force?

946
02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:29.300
  Yes, it's okay.

947
02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:32.300
  If it hurts, please tell me.

948
02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:33.300
  Yes.

949
02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:36.300
  You're really tough.

950
02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:38.300
  Oh, really?

951
02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:42.300
  Do you use a bathrobe?

952
02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:44.300
  Well...

953
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:46.300
  You're alone.

954
02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:51.300
  If I don't give you blood, you'll get hurt.

955
02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:53.300
  Oh, I see.

956
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.300
  You're alone.

957
02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:56.300
  You're looking for a bath in the shower.

958
02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:58.300
  That's right.

959
02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:01.300
  It feels good.

960
02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:03.300
  You're used to it.

961
02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:04.300
  No, no, no.

962
02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:05.300
  Is it long?

963
02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:07.300
  Well...

964
02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:09.300
  It's not that long.

965
02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:11.300
  So...

966
02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:13.300
  Maybe there's something I want to say.

967
02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:15.300
  You're really good.

968
02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.300
  Really?

969
02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:18.300
  I'm glad.

970
02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.640
  Oh, that's great.

971
02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:24.640
  It's okay.

972
02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:25.640
  Oh, it's stretching.

973
02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:26.640
  It's stretching?

974
02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:27.640
  Yes.

975
02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.640
  Well...

976
02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:31.640
  That's right.

977
02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:33.640
  This side is hard.

978
02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:35.640
  Well, it's good.

979
02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:37.640
  That's right.

980
02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:39.640
  Well...

981
02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:41.640
  Yes.

982
02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:43.640
  Please turn to the side.

983
02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:44.640
  Oh, to the side.

984
02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:50.470
  Yes.

985
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:52.470
  I'm sorry.

986
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:55.470
  It's a little cold, so I'll put it on.

987
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:57.470
  Oh, thank you.

988
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:59.470
  I'm sorry.

989
02:11:59.470 --> 02:12:02.910
  There you go.

990
02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:04.910
  Please open your eyes.

991
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:05.910
  Yes.

992
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:07.910
  Thank you.

993
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:13.500
  Excuse me.

994
02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:21.910
  Does it hurt?

995
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:22.910
  Is it okay?

996
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:24.910
  Oh, it's okay.

997
02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.440
  Look at the name of the store.

998
02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.440
  It's written on the name of the store.

999
02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:35.440
  Oh, it's rare.

1000
02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:40.820
  It's really good.

1001
02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:41.820
  Is that so?

1002
02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:45.860
  Yes.

1003
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:47.860
  How long have you been married?

1004
02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:48.860
  What?

1005
02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:50.860
  Well...

1006
02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:53.860
  It's been about 15 years.

1007
02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:55.860
  Oh, I see.

1008
02:12:55.860 --> 02:13:02.300
  Are you close to your husband?

1009
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.300
  Well...

1010
02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:06.300
  The inside is good.

1011
02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:08.300
  Oh, I see.

1012
02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:12.300
  It's very attractive.

1013
02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:13.300
  No, no, no.

1014
02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:15.300
  Thank you very much.

1015
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.300
  Oh, this side is also pasted.

1016
02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:23.300
  Oh, I see.

1017
02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:31.780
  Oh, it feels good there.

1018
02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:37.900
  Here?

1019
02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:38.900
  Oh, I'm sorry.

1020
02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:39.900
  I'm sorry.

1021
02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:40.900
  I'm sorry.

1022
02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:41.900
  Oh, it's okay.

1023
02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:49.760
  Don't worry about it.

1024
02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:52.760
  It hurts, doesn't it?

1025
02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.760
  Does it hurt?

1026
02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:55.760
  Is it okay?

1027
02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:56.760
  Oh, it's okay.

1028
02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:57.760
  Is it okay?

1029
02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:59.760
  Oh, it's coming slowly.

1030
02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:00.760
  It's coming slowly.

1031
02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:01.760
  Is it okay?

1032
02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.760
  Yes.

1033
02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:03.760
  I'll press it.

1034
02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:04.760
  Is it okay?

1035
02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:05.760
  Yes.

1036
02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:11.500
  Are there any children?

1037
02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:13.500
  Oh, there is.

1038
02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.500
  Only one.

1039
02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:15.500
  Yes.

1040
02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:19.580
  I'm glad.

1041
02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:20.580
  What?

1042
02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:21.580
  It's a little...

1043
02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:23.580
  Oh, I'm sorry.

1044
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:25.580
  Oh, I'm sorry.

1045
02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:27.580
  I'm sorry.

1046
02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:29.580
  I'm sorry.

1047
02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:30.580
  I'm doing something bad.

1048
02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:31.580
  No, no.

1049
02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:33.580
  I'm sorry.

1050
02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:38.580
  I didn't think the cat would be able to get surgery with the panties.

1051
02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:43.580
  Oh, I think it's best to accept it with a comfortable costume.

1052
02:14:43.580 --> 02:15:00.500
  It's okay to press it.

1053
02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:02.500
  Is it around here?

1054
02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:24.660
  Yes.

1055
02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:25.660
  Can I ask you to put it on?

1056
02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:26.660
  Can I ask you to put it on?

1057
02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:35.690
  Yes.

1058
02:15:35.690 --> 02:15:38.690
  Recently, my hip joints have been hurting.

1059
02:15:38.690 --> 02:15:41.690
  Oh, I understand.

1060
02:15:41.690 --> 02:15:43.690
  Have you ever been told that it's shallow?

1061
02:15:43.690 --> 02:15:44.690
  What?

1062
02:15:44.690 --> 02:15:45.690
  Have you ever been told that it's shallow?

1063
02:15:45.690 --> 02:15:46.690
  Is it shallow?

1064
02:15:46.690 --> 02:15:48.690
  Yes, it's said to be the same as shallow.

1065
02:15:48.690 --> 02:15:49.690
  Is it?

1066
02:15:49.690 --> 02:15:50.690
  Yes.

1067
02:15:50.690 --> 02:15:53.690
  Oh, it's wrinkled around here.

1068
02:15:53.690 --> 02:15:54.690
  Oh, I'm sorry.

1069
02:15:54.690 --> 02:15:57.000
  It's cute.

1070
02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000
  Oh, I'm sorry.

1071
02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
  It's cute.

1072
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:08.540
  Is it here?

1073
02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:17.510
  It's wrinkled.

1074
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:19.510
  Oh, really?

1075
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:21.510
  Then, around here.

1076
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:22.510
  Oh, wait a minute.

1077
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:23.510
  What happened?

1078
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:25.510
  I'm sorry.

1079
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.510
  Is your face okay?

1080
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:28.510
  It's okay.

1081
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:29.510
  Is it painful?

1082
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:30.510
  Yes, it's okay.

1083
02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:38.380
  What happened?

1084
02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:40.380
  Oh, no.

1085
02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:42.380
  Oh, my buttocks.

1086
02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:44.380
  What's wrong with your buttocks?

1087
02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:46.380
  It's like puk puk.

1088
02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:49.380
  Are you okay?

1089
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:51.380
  I'm sorry.

1090
02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:53.380
  I'm sorry.

1091
02:16:59.350 --> 02:17:00.350
  Oh, great.

1092
02:17:01.350 --> 02:17:03.350
  You're fine.

1093
02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:13.880
  This shop doesn't have an option service.

1094
02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:15.880
  Oh, is it an option?

1095
02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:16.880
  Yes.

1096
02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.880
  No, we don't do that kind of service.

1097
02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:23.880
  You know, there's an oil massage at any shop.

1098
02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:25.880
  Oh, really?

1099
02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:28.880
  I don't think there's anything like that.

1100
02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:30.880
  I don't think so.

1101
02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:32.880
  Oh, I'm sorry.

1102
02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:41.500
  I'm sorry.

1103
02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:43.500
  You're a customer.

1104
02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:45.500
  It's warm.

1105
02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:46.500
  It's warm.

1106
02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:48.500
  I didn't do anything.

1107
02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:50.500
  It's like you're breathing.

1108
02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:03.950
  Then, shall we massage somewhere else?

1109
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:04.950
  Oh, yes.

1110
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:06.950
  I'd like you to massage somewhere else.

1111
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:16.230
  Excuse me.

1112
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:18.230
  What's wrong?

1113
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:20.230
  Oh, my buttocks.

1114
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:22.230
  I'm sorry.

1115
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:23.230
  Are you okay?

1116
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:24.230
  I'm fine.

1117
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:26.230
  I'm totally fine.

1118
02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.040
  I'd like to massage your buttocks.

1119
02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.040
  Can I have a massage for your buttocks?

1120
02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:36.040
  My buttocks?

1121
02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:37.040
  Yes.

1122
02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.310
  Like this?

1123
02:18:42.310 --> 02:18:43.310
  Yes.

1124
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:44.310
  I see.

1125
02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:57.080
  I know you don't have an option.

1126
02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:58.080
  Yes.

1127
02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:00.080
  Don't you have a back-up?

1128
02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:03.080
  What's a back-up?

1129
02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:06.080
  You know that, don't you?

1130
02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:07.080
  No.

1131
02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:08.080
  Because you're a tiger.

1132
02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:09.080
  No, I don't do it.

1133
02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:10.080
  You don't do it, do you?

1134
02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:11.080
  I don't do it.

1135
02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.080
  I'm in trouble.

1136
02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.960
  It's amazing.

1137
02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:19.960
  If you get hit by a stick...

1138
02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:22.960
  Oh, come on.

1139
02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:44.120
  Please promise me you won't tell anyone.

1140
02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:45.120
  Of course.

1141
02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:47.120
  I won't tell anyone.

1142
02:20:01.890 --> 02:20:02.890
  I'll open the door for you.

1143
02:20:02.890 --> 02:20:03.890
  Okay.

1144
02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:18.440
  Please don't tell anyone.

1145
02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:20.440
  Of course.

1146
02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:22.440
  I won't tell anyone.

1147
02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:58.840
  If you get hit by a stick...

1148
02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:00.840
  Don't talk to anyone.

1149
02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:01.840
  No, no.

1150
02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:03.840
  I'm in trouble.

1151
02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:05.840
  Just a little bit.

1152
02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:06.840
  No, no.

1153
02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:07.840
  What?

1154
02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:08.840
  No, no.

1155
02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:10.840
  I'm in trouble.

1156
02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:33.870
  Please keep it a secret.

1157
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:34.870
  Okay.

1158
02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:58.130
  Like this?

1159
02:21:58.130 --> 02:21:59.130
  It feels good.

1160
02:21:59.130 --> 02:22:03.550
  Yes.

1161
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:05.550
  This feels the best when I massage you.

1162
02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:08.990
  I see.

1163
02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:32.740
  You lick me like crazy.

1164
02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:33.740
  I see.

1165
02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:37.620
  What have you been up to lately?

1166
02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:40.620
  I'm having a lesson with my husband.

1167
02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:42.620
  I see.

1168
02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:49.820
  It's a good time, isn't it?

1169
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:16.430
  It's a lesson, isn't it?

1170
02:23:16.430 --> 02:23:18.430
  That's right, but...

1171
02:23:18.430 --> 02:23:19.430
  It's not good, is it?

1172
02:23:19.430 --> 02:23:21.430
  No, it's not.

1173
02:23:21.430 --> 02:23:22.430
  Why not?

1174
02:23:23.430 --> 02:23:25.430
  Just my hands.

1175
02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:28.430
  You said just your hands, but you're talking.

1176
02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:31.430
  All you have to do is put it in.

1177
02:23:31.430 --> 02:23:32.430
  Put it in?

1178
02:23:32.430 --> 02:23:43.510
  Yes.

1179
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:59.560
  I won't let go of it.

1180
02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:14.140
  Please show it to me.

1181
02:25:20.570 --> 02:25:21.570
  Wait a minute.

1182
02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:25.390
  That's...

1183
02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:40.140
  If you're not doing it with your husband,

1184
02:25:40.140 --> 02:25:42.140
  you're hiding, aren't you?

1185
02:25:42.140 --> 02:26:08.680
  Your pants are wet, aren't they?

1186
02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:09.680
  What?

1187
02:26:19.650 --> 02:26:27.760
  You're not doing it with your husband, are you?

1188
02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:44.560
  You're not doing it with your husband, are you?

1189
02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:45.560
  Here.

1190
02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:47.560
  Put it on your butt.

1191
02:27:25.890 --> 02:27:27.890
  It's not good.

1192
02:27:27.890 --> 02:27:29.890
  It's not good.

1193
02:27:29.890 --> 02:27:31.890
  It's not good.

1194
02:27:31.890 --> 02:28:00.220
  Please don't cry.

1195
02:28:26.390 --> 02:28:28.390
  Does it feel good?

1196
02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:29.390
  Yes.

1197
02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:31.390
  It feels good.

1198
02:28:32.390 --> 02:28:35.830
  It's all over your butt.

1199
02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:50.680
  One finger isn't enough, is it?

1200
02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:53.680
  That's a lie.

1201
02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:58.680
  That's not good.

1202
02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.680
  It feels good.

1203
02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:11.430
  It's raining.

1204
02:29:12.430 --> 02:30:28.350
  It's raining.

1205
02:30:28.350 --> 02:30:30.350
  It feels good.

1206
02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:40.350
  It's raining.

1207
02:30:40.350 --> 02:30:42.350
  It hurts.

1208
02:30:46.350 --> 02:31:48.960
  That's not good.

1209
02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:50.960
  It feels good.

1210
02:31:57.640 --> 02:31:59.640
  It hurts a little, doesn't it?

1211
02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:03.640
  That's not good.

1212
02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:04.640
  It's not good.

1213
02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:06.640
  Be honest.

1214
02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:10.270
  But...

1215
02:32:10.270 --> 02:32:48.400
  It's not good to put it in.

1216
02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:52.860
  It's not good to put it in.

1217
02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:54.860
  It's not good.

1218
02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:56.860
  It's crumpled.

1219
02:32:56.860 --> 02:32:58.860
  Just a little.

1220
02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:43.720
  Compared to your husband.

1221
02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:50.340
  Please don't tell the store.

1222
02:33:55.740 --> 02:33:58.740
  It's not good to put it in.

1223
02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:23.460
  It's good to put it in.

1224
02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:14.210
  It's hot.

1225
02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:16.210
  It's not good.

1226
02:35:17.210 --> 02:35:19.210
  It's hot.

1227
02:35:21.210 --> 02:35:23.210
  It's not good to put it in.

1228
02:35:23.210 --> 02:35:25.210
  It's not good.

1229
02:35:25.210 --> 02:35:27.210
  It's not good to put it in.

1230
02:35:27.210 --> 02:35:29.210
  It's not good.

1231
02:35:31.210 --> 02:35:33.210
  It's not good.

1232
02:35:33.210 --> 02:36:29.450
  It's not good.

1233
02:36:34.450 --> 02:36:36.450
  How is it?

1234
02:37:12.430 --> 02:37:14.430
  You're in a bad mood.

1235
02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:10.590
  You're crying all the time.

1236
02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:22.290
  Which do you want?

1237
02:38:24.290 --> 02:38:26.290
  I'm embarrassed.

1238
02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:29.290
  Tell me.

1239
02:38:29.290 --> 02:38:31.290
  Which do you want?

1240
02:38:31.290 --> 02:38:49.260
  Which do you want?

1241
02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:51.260
  I'm embarrassed.

1242
02:39:30.370 --> 02:39:32.370
  It feels good, doesn't it?

1243
02:39:32.370 --> 02:39:34.370
  It feels good, doesn't it?

1244
02:39:34.370 --> 02:39:36.370
  It feels good, doesn't it?

1245
02:39:57.100 --> 02:40:02.390
  It hurts.

1246
02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:21.780
  It hurts.

1247
02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.980
  It hurts.

1248
02:40:25.980 --> 02:40:27.980
  It feels good, doesn't it?

1249
02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:33.340
  It hurts.

1250
02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:30.180
  It really hurts.

1251
02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:32.180
  It really hurts.

1252
02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:50.400
  Hold your feet.

1253
02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:52.400
  Show me your ankle.

1254
02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:54.400
  Show me your ankle.

1255
02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:56.400
  It hurts.

1256
02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.400
  It hurts.

1257
02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.570
  Don't spread your legs.

1258
02:42:07.570 --> 02:42:09.570
  Don't spread your legs.

1259
02:42:09.570 --> 02:42:11.570
  It hurts.

1260
02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:13.570
  It hurts.

1261
02:42:13.570 --> 02:42:15.570
  It doesn't matter.

1262
02:42:15.570 --> 02:42:17.570
  It doesn't matter.

1263
02:42:17.570 --> 02:42:28.430
  It doesn't matter.

1264
02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:44.880
  It's a different angle.

1265
02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:07.620
  Are you going again?

1266
02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.620
  I'm going.

1267
02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:11.620
  I'm going.

1268
02:43:23.890 --> 02:43:33.220
  It's going.

1269
02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:35.220
  It's going.

1270
02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:37.220
  It's going.

1271
02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:39.220
  It's going.

1272
02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:11.810
  It's a different angle.

1273
02:44:11.810 --> 02:44:13.810
  It's a different angle.

1274
02:44:23.810 --> 02:44:27.150
  Oh my god!

1275
02:44:39.370 --> 02:44:41.370
  He is shaking hands and legs.

1276
02:44:46.470 --> 02:44:47.590
  It's so far.

1277
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:49.910
  This is no good.

1278
02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:51.270
  I have a cramp.

1279
02:44:51.270 --> 02:44:52.150
  It's okay.

1280
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:56.090
  I'm sorry.

1281
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:59.510
  Oh my god.

1282
02:44:59.510 --> 02:45:07.660
  It feels so good...

1283
02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:26.560
  You know how easy it is to be a dork, right?

1284
02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:28.900
  It really feels good, right?

1285
02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:48.130
  You had a lot of hahahaha gel.

1286
02:45:48.130 --> 02:45:49.470
  Can I get it out?

1287
02:45:49.470 --> 02:45:52.510
  Why?

1288
02:45:52.510 --> 02:45:53.850
  It's cold...

1289
02:45:53.850 --> 02:45:55.950
  I'm hungry...

1290
02:45:55.950 --> 02:45:58.450
  That's ok, if you have sex with a man...

1291
02:45:58.450 --> 02:46:00.470
  But I'm...

1292
02:46:00.470 --> 02:46:02.210
  I'm sorry...

1293
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:10.660
  You can't do anything about it?

1294
02:46:10.660 --> 02:46:22.990
  I can't do anything about it.

1295
02:46:54.940 --> 02:46:55.940
  You can't do anything about it, right?

1296
02:46:55.940 --> 02:47:11.160
  I can't do anything about it.

1297
02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:35.400
  It feels so good.

1298
02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:36.400
  It feels good.

1299
02:47:46.330 --> 02:47:47.330
  I'm about to die.

1300
02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:15.820
  Clean it up.

1301
02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:49.290
  It's all crumpled up.

1302
02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:59.500
  Are you satisfied with the massage?

1303
02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:01.500
  Of course.

1304
02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:07.140
  Please don't tell the owner that it's crumpled up.

1305
02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:09.140
  I won't tell him.

1306
02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:13.140
  I'll be waiting for another massage.
